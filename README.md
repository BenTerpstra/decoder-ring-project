# decoder-ring-project
Repository for decoder ring capstone project

Contains functions to encode and decode messages using 3 different ciphers: a Caesar Shift, a Polybius Square, and a Substitution Key. Contains 64 tests using Mocha/Chai to evaluate the quality of this code.

I'm not gonna lie, I'm pretty proud of the fact that this project has exactly 2^6 tests passing in it (including the ones written by Thinkful).

Additional note: opening Qualified assessments stresses me out because the timer starts and there's no way to pause it, so I wound up taking a crack at researching these ciphers and then programming them independently before opening it in qualified. 
My original code can be seen in my initial commit to GitHub.
It took me ~5 hrs to write the algorithms themselves (primarily tested by logging output to the console.) The rest of the time I spent in the assessment (~3 hrs) modifying my code to satisfy the constraints of the test. My original code functioned in a VERY different environment, with separate functions for encoding and decoding, for example.

All this to say, in the interest of transparency, while the timer on Qualified may show a time of ~3 hrs, the actual total time spent writing this program was closer to 8 hrs.
